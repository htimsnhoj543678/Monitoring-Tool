What you see here is everything I wrote before she gave us the graph.txt and attack.txt files. Those will need to be implemented on top of what we already have.
"Main" and "Manager" are the two runnable files. Main is currently being used to test the node logic, manager is being used to just display the map and the
nodes and eventually their connections etc. I haven't combined these yet and thats something else well have to do. 
There will be an input panel underneath the map where we can input commands to add nodes/attacks etc to play around with in real-time
on top of the nodes/connections/attacks that will already be there from the .txt files she gave us.
